# Developer Word

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to show you a piece of what I can do.
Apart from the completed Express code, you can find a React frontend app to test the different endpoints. To run this frontend app, you can run:

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend app will run on port 3000. I've added the `cors` package to the Express server for you to be able to run both codebases simultaneously.
